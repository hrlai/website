<h2><a href="#traitSDM">Trait-based species distribution modelling</a></h2>
<p>Species distribution models are hindered by narrow prediction horizons: they often describe local or snapshot phenomena well, but transfer very poorly to new locations, new time periods, or new taxa. This project aims to develop a prediction horizon framework for identifying distribution models that explain how traits govern species adaptations to local environments while also project well into future, distant conditions. The developed framework will improve the prediction accuracy of the spread of undesired species or the decline of species vulnerable to global change.</p>

<h2>Higher-order biotic interactions</h2>
<p>In plant systems, a branch of ecology focuses on how individual tree growth responds to biotic interactions. To date, most studies only examine the direct competitive or facilitative interactions between species pairs, despite the increasing evidence for demography to be driven by indirect interactions when additional species interfere with the direct, pairwise interaction through intrasitive loops or non-additivity. Indirect interactions may prevent a species from extirpation by countering strong direct competitive interactions, thereby maintaining diversity especially in species-rich systems.</p>

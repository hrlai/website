<p>Ursula K. Le Guin (1929–2018) writes science fictions that are strangely beautiful. Maybe it isn’t too strange that they contain memorable lines that are strangely applicable to science, and life in general. Here are two from <em>The Left Hand of Darkness</em> (1969).</p>
<blockquote>
<p>To learn which questions are unanswerable, and not to answer them: this skill is most needful in times of stress and darkness.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>When action grows unprofitable, gather information; when information grows unprofitable, sleep.</p>
</blockquote>

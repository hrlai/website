Some digestions after reading 
> Houlahan, J. E., McKinney, S. T., Anderson, T. M., & McGill, B. J. (2017). The priority of prediction in ecological understanding. *Oikos*, 126(1), 1--7.

- Prediction is not (yet) a central focus in ecology
- If prediction were central in ecology, model selection would be done very differently
    - "Parsimony holds a hallowed place in model selection"
    - When data are limited, complex models are more likely to capture idiosyncrasies of the data rather than true underlying processes
    - However, this problem is entirely due to limitations the data impose on our ability to detect the underlying process, rather than on any inherent value of simple models
- Ecological models can be improved by\
    :blush: identifying important variables\
    :thinking: elucidating functional relationships\
    :weary: improving parameter estimates
- Without prediction, it is difficult to know if we understand more today than we did yesterday
- Without temporal transferability, our understanding is ephemeral and temporary
- Also hard to generalise
- Many ecological hypotheses are quantitative 
- Many ecological studies are still null-hypothesis testing
- Many truly continuous variables are still used categorically
- Popper (paraphrased): "...demonstrating understanding is a slow and iterative process that relies on (in)correct and risky predictions." 
- Then why aren't we doing more predictions?
    - Funding sources and employers look for novelty, not confirmatory/reproduced science
    - Validating published models is unappealing
    - Pure science without immediate real-world implementations not worth getting super-accurate prediction

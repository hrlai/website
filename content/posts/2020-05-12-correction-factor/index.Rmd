To correct for back-transformation bias in log-transformed allometric models, we multiply the predictions, $\hat{Y}$ by the correction factor, $$CF = e^{\sigma^2_v / 2} = e^{\text{MSE}/2}, $$ where MSE is the mean square error of a model. For the log--log model, the corrected prediction is thus

\begin{align}
    \hat{Y} &= e^a \log(X+1)^b CF \\
    \log \hat{Y} &= a + b \log (\log (X+1)) + \log{CF}.
\end{align}

Previously I *wrongly* stated that the correction factor cannot be built into the log--log or exp equations for reporting, but this can actually be done. Rearranging the above we get:

\begin{align}
    \log \hat{Y} &= (a + \log{CF}) + b \log (\log (X+1)) \\
    &= a' + b \log (\log (X+1)).
\end{align}

We can then just report the newly defined $a' = a + \log{CF}$, which already has the correction factor built in.

The same operation can be performed on the exponential model (and more easily so):

\begin{align}
    \hat{Y} &= e^{a + bX} CF \\
    &= e^{a + bX + \log{CF}} \\
    \log \hat{Y} &= a + bX + \log{CF} \\
    &= (a + \log{CF}) + bX \\
    &= a' + bX,
\end{align}
thus yielding the same reported $a' = a + \log{CF}$.

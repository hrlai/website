<p>The previous years have been about rabbit holes and getting stuck/unstuck.
As a consequence, manuscripts piled up and got released this year as a bunch of
preprints. They are now in various stages of submission, rejection, revision,
and at least some acceptance (phew).</p>

<h2>Accepted</h2>

<li><a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.tree.2024.01.009">The propagation of disturbances in ecological networks</a></li>

<p>Learning to write faster and better. Got to remember that writing and editing are two separate processes.</p>

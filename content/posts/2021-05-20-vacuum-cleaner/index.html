<p>In his seminal paper, Hutchinson (1957) compared maths to a vacuum cleaner:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It is not necessary in any empirical science to keep an elaborate logicomathematical system always apparent, any more than it is necessary to keep a vacuum cleaner conspicuously in the middle of a room at all times. When a lot of irrelevant litter has accumulated the machine must be brought out, used, and then put away.</p>
</blockquote>

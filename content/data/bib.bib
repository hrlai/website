abstract = {Despite the development of network science, we lack clear heuristics for how far different disturbance types propagate within and across species interaction networks. We discuss the mechanisms of disturbance propagation in ecological networks, and propose that disturbances can be categorized into structural, functional, and transmission types according to their spread and effect on network structure and functioning. We describe the properties of species and their interaction networks and metanetworks that determine the indirect, spatial, and temporal extent of propagation. We argue that the sampling scale of ecological studies may have impeded predictions regarding the rate and extent that a disturbance spreads, and discuss directions to help ecologists to move towards a predictive understanding of the propagation of impacts across interacting communities and ecosystems.},

abstract = {Questions: How (de)coupled are native and exotic tree diversities in their relationships with local soil conditions and landscape configurations? Can (de)coupled diversity–environment relationships be used to manage native and exotic species separately to minimize unintended impacts on one another?. Location: The tropical city-state of Singapore, Southeast Asia. Methods: In two types of novel, exotic-dominated secondary forests regenerating from land abandonment, we surveyed both native and exotic trees ≥5 cm diameter-at-breast height (DBH) in 97 plots and correlated taxonomic and functional diversities to soil fertility (nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium) and landscape configuration gradients (distance to old-growth forests and patch area). Results: Native and exotic tree species had unshared or decoupled responses to distance to old-growth forest and soil phosphorus. The taxonomic and functional diversities of native, but not exotic, species declined rapidly with increasing isolation from old-growth forests. Exotic, but not native, species richness increased with soil phosphorus levels. Neither native nor exotic diversities were associated with soil nitrogen, potassium, and patch area. Conclusions: Native and exotic tree species could be managed separately without unintended impacts on one another because of their decoupled responses to distance from old-growth forest and soil phosphorus. The native–distance-to-old-growth relationship suggests that novel secondary forests adjacent to old-growth forests can accrue native species with minimal intervention, while enhancement plantings of old-growth native species should target more isolated patches. The exotic-phosphorus relationship suggests that restoring soils to historically-low phosphorus levels can help to reduce exotic diversity, without negative impacts on native diversity. Our study highlights the importance of understanding (de)coupled species or species-group responses to identify optimal management solutions with minimal non-target effects.},

abstract = {Context: Tropical forest loss has a major impact on climate change. Secondary forest growth has potential to mitigate these impacts, but uncertainty regarding future land use, remote sensing limitations, and carbon model accuracy have inhibited understanding the range of potential future carbon dynamics. Objectives: We evaluated the effects of four scenarios on carbon stocks and sequestration in a mixed-use landscape based on Recent Trends (RT), Accelerated Deforestation (AD), Grow Only (GO), and Grow Everything (GE) scenarios. Methods: Working in central Panama, we coupled a 1-ha resolution LiDAR derived carbon map with a locally derived secondary forest carbon accumulation model. We used Dinamica EGO 4.0.5 to spatially simulate forest loss across the landscape based on recent deforestation rates. We used local studies of belowground, woody debris, and liana carbon to estimate ecosystem scale carbon fluxes. Results: Accounting for 58.6 percent of the forest in 2020, secondary forests (< 50 years) accrue 88.9 percent of carbon in the GO scenario by 2050. RT and AD scenarios lost 36,707 and 177,035 ha of forest respectively by 2030, a carbon gain of 7.7 million Mg C (RT) and loss of 2.9 million Mg C (AD). Growing forest on all available land (GE) could achieve 56 percent of Panama's land-based carbon sequestration goal by 2050. Conclusions: Our estimates of potential carbon storage demonstrate the important contribution of secondary forests to land-based carbon sequestration in central Panama. Protecting these forests will contribute significantly to meeting Panama's climate change mitigation goals and enhance water security.},

abstract = {Functional traits offer generalizability to the prediction of ecosystem processes such as production, and community-weighted mean trait values are increasingly used for such predictions. However, the underlying causal direction between traits and ecosystem processes are often indirect and sometimes even tenuous. In this study, we aimed to uncover underlying causal mechanisms between traits, habitat adaptation and canopy productivity. We used canopy production data estimated from leaf litter traps, and trait and habitat association data obtained from 40 permanent vegetation plots in the Nee Soon catchment in Singapore, which contains a heterogeneous mix of freshwater swamp and dry-land tropical forests. Mean canopy production across the catchment was estimated to be 768 g m−2 year−1, which is similar to other tropical dry-land forests in the region. Biweekly per-basal-area canopy production was found to be consistently lower in swamp than non-swamp plots, and positively correlated with monthly mean temperature. Structural equation models fitted to data of canopy production, leaf traits, plot type (swamp versus non-swamp), basal areas and habitat adaptations of 69 tree species–plot combinations suggested that tree species possessing leaf traits associated with more conservative resource acquisition strategies, viz. low specific leaf area, high leaf C:N ratio, and thicker leaves, are better adapted to stressful, waterlogged swamp conditions, but that this adaptation also reduces canopy—and likely total—net primary productivity. These observations suggest that the stressful conditions of waterlogged, anoxic swamp habitats significantly reduce the rate at which nutrients are cycled by communities found in such environments.},

While longitudinal or chronosequence data are powerful tools for doing so, the traditional focus on community-level shifts in taxonomic and functional composition rather than species-level trait–demography relationships has made generalisation difficult. Using joint species distribution models, we demonstrate how three traits—photosynthetic rate, adult stature, and seed mass—moderate recruitment and sapling mortality rates of 46 woody species during secondary succession. We show that the pioneer syndrome emerges from higher photosynthetic rates, shorter adult statures and lighter seeds that facilitate exploitation of light in younger secondary forests, while ‘long-lived pioneer' and ‘late successional' syndromes are associated with trait values that enable species to persist in the understory or reach the upper canopy in older secondary forests. Our study highlights the context dependency of trait–demography relationships, which drive successional shifts in sapling's species composition in secondary forests.},

abstract = {Trees are important components of urban greenery because of their large stature and longevity, and their ability to enhance the environmental quality of city landscapes. However, benefits and hazards associated with trees depend on their size, which changes over time and varies among species. While urban trees are often measured during routine management, the full value of these data is rarely realised. Our study uses nation-wide inspection records from Singapore to develop allometric models for 54 species grown in the urban tropics (n = 345 794), a region that is poorly represented in allometric literature. We use the height-diameter relationship to demonstrate how analyses of existing datasets can be used to support decisions on tree inspection and maintenance. The accuracy of models developed separately for each species (single-species models) and using the pooled data for all species (mixed-effects model) was compared. Model outputs and derived metrics were used to detect height outliers and priority regions that may require greater inspection effort, which we summarise using spatial visualisations and an online web application. Model parameters also varied according to each species' pruning intensity and maximum height, and can thus provide a useful heuristic when selecting species to plant. Such data-driven approaches have the potential to support both management and research, though changes to workflows may be needed to take advantage of new sources of data. Integrating multiple datasets into decision-making will require expertise across multiple disciplines, and coordinated action among stakeholders. By sharing the code used to develop the allometric models in a new open-source R package 'allometree', we hope to promote reproducibility and facilitate the application of allometric equations to other tree parameters, study regions and management objectives.},

abstract = {Questions: How do abiotic conditions, forest structure, as well as taxonomic and functional diversities and composition recover after wind-generated treefalls? Do young and old-growth secondary forests differ in their responses?. Location: Mandai region of the Central Catchment Nature Reserve, Singapore, where extensive treefalls occurred during an unusually powerful windstorm in 2011. Southeast Asia. Methods: Soil nitrogen, phosphorous, potassium, canopy cover, leaf litter depth, coarse woody debris, and woody stems ≥1-cm diameter were measured and identified in 10 × 10 m plots. Twenty-six plots were located in treefall areas and 14 plots were located in relatively unaffected areas, with equal numbers in young and old-growth secondary forest types. The first round of surveys took place within 3–6 months of the windstorm event and yearly re-surveys were conducted until 2015. Specific leaf area, leaf dry matter content, leaf thickness, woody density, maximum plant height, and seed dry mass were measured or derived from various sources. Results: There was a pulse of soil nutrient availability in both affected and unaffected areas 1 year after the wind event. Canopy cover and basal area in the affected areas recovered to similar levels as unaffected areas by the second year, and coarse woody debris by the fourth year. In affected plots, taxonomic and functional diversities increased and overshot that of—and taxonomic composition diverged from—unaffected plots after the second year. Young and old-growth secondary forest types mainly differed in the taxonomic composition of new recruits. However, there was no evidence of changes in functional composition towards resource-acquisitive strategies such as lower wood density or higher specific leaf area. Conclusions: Abiotic conditions and basal area recovered rapidly within 2–4 years after the windstorm. Taxonomic composition in young and old-growth affected forests both diverged from unaffected forests but also from each other over time.},

abstract = {Understanding how functional traits moderate species' demographic responses along environmental gradients is a core pursuit in ecology, often to predict how species abundances will respond to a rapidly changing environment. The latter necessitates species demography, or at least abundance, to be modelled directly as a response; yet, most studies till date use abundance indirectly to calculate and then correlate community-aggregated trait indices to environmental variables, rendering the prediction of species demographic responses along environmental gradients unfeasible. Using a hierarchical Bayesian approach that stems from joint species distribution modelling, we modelled the recruitments of 53 woody plant species along windstorm-generated environmental gradients from twenty-eight 100-m2 tropical secondary forest plots censused over 5 years in Singapore, and then examined whether environmental responses across species can be explained and generalized by functional traits. We found that species recruitment along the light-availability gradient was moderated by wood density, in that low wood-density species responded more positively to elevated light conditions by being more responsive in height growth. Seed mass moderated species recruitment along the leaf litter depth gradient, such that large-seeded species with greater energy reserves recruited more in sites with thicker leaf litter depths than small-seeded species. Shorter- and taller-statured species recruited more in historically short- and tall-canopied forest sites, respectively, indicating an influence from surrounding parent trees and the importance of considering dispersal limitation in successional studies. Leaf economic traits (specific leaf area, leaf dry-matter content and lamina thickness) did not moderate recruitment responses across environments, suggesting a weak role of leaf traits during the earlier life stages or their high plasticity. Synthesis. Wood density, seed mass and adult stature are the main traits that moderate sapling recruitment in our wind-generated forest gaps. The roles of multiple traits in moderating the shared environmental responses across species may be crucial in the maintenance of coexistence and diversity through niche partitioning. Most importantly, we estimated the strength and direction of trait effects on species responses to environmental changes during succession. These are potentially generalizable results that can directly predict the demographic responses of any species—given its traits—to environmental changes.},

abstract = {Elevated levels of airborne particulate matter (PM) pose health risks to populations living in many cities worldwide. To remediate the impact of air pollution, urban greening has been increasingly explored as a possible way to remove PM from the surroundings. However, existing research focuses mainly on species-specific assessments within temperate climates that may not necessarily grow outside of their local regions. To address sampling limitations associated with the great species diversity in the tropics, our study quantified three key functional traits—leaf hairiness, average leaf area (ALA) and specific leaf area (SLA)—each spanning a wide range of values across 20 tropical species. Wind-tunnel experiments were used to assess surface deposition velocity on leaves; the size fractions PM10 and PM2.5 were measured through multiple rounds of filtration and gravimetric analysis. The effects of upper- and lower-surfaces of leaves on deposition velocity and their interactions with hairiness were also investigated. Results show that greater upper-surface hairiness and a low SLA were consistent predictors of higher deposition velocity for both PM-size fractions. Hairs on leaves serve as obstacles while low SLA tends to be associated with smaller and thicker leaves, together favoring the deposition and retention of PM. The possible mechanisms behind important plant traits and their interactions are discussed. By testing quantifiable effects of specific plant traits, we provide generalizable findings that may be applied to urban greening efforts. Future work to consider other gaseous pollutants and plant-scale effects can help ensure a more comprehensive evaluation of plant suitability for pollutant mitigation.},

abstract = {Soil resource partitioning and dispersal limitation have been shown to shape the tree community structure of mature tropical forests, but are poorly studied in the context of forest succession. We examined the relative contributions of both ecological processes to the variation in the species composition of young tropical secondary forests at different spatial scales, and if the relative importance of these two ecological processes changed during succession. At the species level, we examined if the association between species abundances and soil fertility differed between early and late successional species and/or changed over the course of succession. We used vegetation and soil data from 47 secondary forest sites with two plots each in a tropical agricultural landscape. A distance-based redundancy analysis and variation partitioning were employed to examine the relative importance of spatial distance (proxy for dispersal limitation) and heterogeneity in soil nutrients (proxy for soil nutrient partitioning) at the landscape scale, and a linear regression to test their effects at the local scale. We examined interspecific variation in species' responses to successional age and soil nutrients with a joint species distribution model. Dispersal limitation and soil niche partitioning drove considerable variation in the composition of plant communities at local and landscape scales. The relative contribution of these two ecological processes changed with scale (local vs. landscape) and topography (lower slope vs. upper slope plots). At the species level, significant abundance–soil fertility associations were mostly positive. Most species became less responsive to soil nutrients over the first few decades of tropical forest succession, probably because light became the main limiting resource in older forests. Synthesis. Our key finding is that spatial heterogeneity in soil resources and spatial distance jointly drive compositional variation within and across early successional forests. Our results highlight that a network of forest fragments enhances the resilience of ecological processes and the potential of secondary forests to restore and preserve biodiversity in human-modified landscapes. To advance our understanding of ecological succession, we need to move beyond single-factor and local-scale studies and examine the effects of multiple variables on succession at different spatial scales.},

abstract = {Background: According to modern coexistence theory, ecologically similar species can coexist if fitness differences between them are small, or niche differences between them are large. However, these predictions have not been tested extensively in real systems and are difficult to examine in traits-based studies. Aims: The aim of our study was, by using the carnivorous pitcher plant genus Nepenthes as a model system, to examine (1) species growth ranks as a proxy for fitness; (2) modern coexistence theory at a geographical scale; (3) evidence for pitcher trait-mediated resource partitioning between sympatric Nepenthes species. Methods: We used growth ranks, obtained from a survey of experienced Nepenthes nursery owners, as a proxy for fitness. Multivariate pitcher-, vegetative- or combined-trait distances, computed from morphometric-trait data from the literature were used as proxies for niche differences. Data on global Nepenthes species-pair sympatry was modelled against these fitness and niche differences. Results: Niche and growth rate differences were positively and negatively correlated with sympatry, respectively, as expected from theory. Conclusion: Our results agree with theory and suggest that fitness differences can be approximated from average species growth. Prey- and microhabitat-resource partitioning, operating through divergent pitcher and vegetative traits respectively, are likely mechanisms that stabilise the coexistence of sympatric Nepenthes species.},

abstract = {1. Coexistence between plant species is well known to depend on the outcomes of species interactions within an environmental context. The incorporation of environmental variation into empirical studies of coexistence are rare, however, due to the complex experiments needed to do so and the lack of feasible modelling approaches for determining how environmental factors alter specific coexistence mechanisms. 2. In this article, we present a simple modelling framework for assessing how variation in species interactions across environmental gradients impact on niche overlap and fitness differences, two core determinants of coexistence. We use a novel formulation of an annual plant population dynamics model that allows for competitive and facilitative species interactions and for variation in the strength and direction of these interactions across environmental gradients. Using this framework , we examine outcomes of plant-plant interactions between four commonly co-occurring annual plant species from Western Australian woodlands. We then determine how niche overlap and fitness differences between these species vary across three environmental gradients previously identified as important for struc-turing diversity patterns in this system: soil phosphorus, shade and water. 3. We found facilitation to be a widespread phenomenon and that interactions between most species pairs shift between competitive and facilitative across multiple environmental gradients. Environmental conditions also altered the strength, direction and relative variation of both niche overlap and fitness differences in nonlinear and unpredictable ways. 4. Synthesis. We provide a simple framework for incorporating environmental het-erogeneity into explorations of coexistence mechanisms. Our findings highlight the importance of the environment in determining the outcome of species interactions and the potential for pairwise coexistence between species. The prevalence of facilitation in our system indicates a need to improve current theoretical frameworks of coexistence to include noncompetitive interactions and ways of translating these effects into explicit predictions of coexistence. Our study also suggests a need for further research into determining which factors result in},

abstract = {Climate change is predicted to have profound consequences for multispecies coexistence, and thus, patterns of biological diversity. These consequences will be mediated by direct and indirect impacts of environmental change on species' vital rates and interactions. While the impacts of environmental change on individual species has received much attention to date, the consequences for coexistence mediated by changes in the strength and direction of multispecies interactions are not as well understood. To investigate how coexistence dynamics may be sensitive to environmental change, we conducted a field experiment in a diverse semi-arid annual plant system. We imposed a water manipulation treatment in two sites that vary in aridity and associated rainfall. Focusing on four common annual plant species in these sites, we quantified the fecundity (seed production) of individuals in response to a gradient of intra- and interspecific competitor densities and aridity. We then used these fecundities to parameterize an annual plant population model and examine the influence of aridity and species identity on resultant coexistence dynamics (as a function of stabilizing niche differences and fitness inequalities). While the responses of some vital rates and competitive impacts to watering varied somewhat predictably across sites, coexistence metrics encapsulating changes in these vital rates and interaction strengths did not. Fitness inequalities among our focal species were driven largely by differences in sensitivity to competition, which were almost always much greater than the magnitude of stabilizing niche differences. These findings were surprising given observational evidence suggesting that these species do coexist at local scales in these natural communities. Synthesis. Our study is one of the first to explicitly consider the influence of environmental variation on the individual components of coexistence outcomes. We show that environmental change has the ability to influence coexistence not only through direct pathways (i.e., vital rates), but also indirect pathways (i.e., species interactions). Despite the consistency of many of the responses of these individual components to environmental variation, their combined influence on predictions of both current and future coexistence remains unclear.},

abstract = {1.Nitrogen‐fixing trees (N2 fixers) provide new nitrogen critical for rapid biomass accumulation of tropical forests during early secondary succession, but it remains unclear how the abundance of N2 fixers in the forest community affects the growth of non‐fixers or the primary productivity of the whole forest. 2.On the one hand, N2 fixers may enhance forest productivity by providing a facilitative effect through the provision of plant‐available nitrogen to non‐fixing trees. On the other hand, N2 fixers may suppress the growth of non‐fixers by growing faster and competing more vigorously for light and other resources. A third alternative is that the growth of N2 fixers themselves accumulate biomass rapidly, while having a neutral effect on non‐fixers, leading to an overall increase in forest biomass. 3.We examine these alternative hypotheses using five‐year tree census data from 88 plots in 44 seasonal tropical moist secondary forests (3–32 years old) across a human‐modified landscape in central Panama. We examined whether N2 fixers accumulated biomass more rapidly than non‐fixers, and how relative biomass of N2 fixers as a functional group and as individual species influenced the growth of non‐fixer and whole stand primary productivity. 4.Surprisingly, we found no evidence for either a net competitive or a facilitative effect of N2 fixers as a functional group or individual species on the biomass recovery in these young forests. N2 fixers did not grow faster than non‐fixers. Individual mortality rates were lower among N2 fixers, but biomass losses due to mortality were similar between the two groups. Overall, we found no relationship between the relative abundance of N2 fixers and stand primary productivity during succession. 5.Synthesis: N2‐fixing trees may be critical for reducing nitrogen limitation and accelerating biomass growth during tropical secondary forest succession, thereby impacting the global carbon cycle. However, our findings indicate that, in early successional seasonal tropical moist forests, N2 fixers provide neither a net competitive nor a facilitative effect on non‐fixing trees or the whole forest stand, likely because tropical N2 fixers utilize facultative fixation and hence abundance poorly approximates the ecosystem function of fixation. Our results indicate that models should not simply scale symbiotic fixation and its effects from N2‐fixing tree abundance.},

abstract = {Aim A rich literature on forest succession provides general expectations for the steps forests go through while reassembling after disturbance, yet we still have a surprisingly poor understanding of why the outcomes of forest recovery after logging (or other disturbances) vary so extensively. In this paper, we test the hypothesis that regional species pool, system productivity, climate and landscape structure are important drivers of forest reassembly outcomes. Location Transect 1,500 km in length along the east coast of Australia. Time period Survey of 50- to 60-year-old rain forest regrowth and primary forest conducted in 2012 and 2013. Major taxa studied Rain forest plants. Methods In this study, we compare species and functional diversity patterns in pairs of remnant and regrowth (‘secondary') rain forests spread across a 1,500 km climate and productivity gradient along the east coast of Australia. Our controlled natural experiment was designed to test the importance of regional species pool, system productivity, climate and landscape structure as drivers of species and functional diversity in regenerating forests. Notably, our study design allowed us to hold soil type, general forest type and disturbance history relatively constant in order to test our hypotheses effectively. Results Counter to expectations, few tested factors were strongly related to the recovery of species or functional diversity in regenerating Australian rain forests. The extent of local forest fragmentation was the only factor strongly related to differences between regrowth forests and primary forest remnants, and then only for functional diversity. We found no evidence that species diversity is a reasonable proxy for, or potential driver of, functional diversity patterns. Main conclusions Our findings suggest that forest functional recovery over decades is influenced more by regional landscape context than distinct assembly processes operating across climate and productivity gradients.},

abstract = {Secondary forests are important carbon sinks, but their biomass dynamics vary markedly within and across landscapes. The biotic and abiotic drivers of this variation are still not well understood. We tested the effects of soil resource availability and competition by lia- nas on the biomass dynamics of young secondary tropical forests in Panama and assessed the extent to which liana effects were mediated by soil resource availability. Over a five- year peri- od, growth, mortality, and recruitment of woody plants of ≥1 cm diameter were monitored in 84 plots in 3–30- year- old secondary forests across the Agua Salud site in central Panama. Biomass dynamics and the effects of lianas and soil resources were examined using (general- ized) linear mixed- effect models and a model averaging approach. There was strong spatial and temporal variation in liana biomass within and across the plots. The relative biomass of lianas had a strong negative effect on overall tree growth, growth of understory trees decreased with soil fertility and dry season soil water content, and the effect of lianas on tree mortality varied with soil fertility. Tree recruitment was not associated with any of the predictor variables. Our model indicates that tree biomass growth across our landscape was reduced with 22% due to competition with lianas, and that the effect of lianas increased during succession, from 19% after five years to 32% after 30 years. The projected liana- induced growth reduction after 60 years was 47%, which was consistent with data from a nearby site. Our study shows that the observed liana proliferation across tropical forests may reduce the sequestration and storage of carbon in young secondary forests, with important implications for the carbon balance of trop- ical forest landscapes and consequently for global climate change. Our study highlights the need to incorporate lianas and soil variables in research on the biomass dynamics of secondary forest across tropical landscapes, and the need for well- replicated longitudinal studies to cover landscape- level variability in the relevant abiotic and biotic components.},

It remains unclear; however, if this variety of impacts is due to different invader strategies, features of recipient communities or both. To test this, we examined multiple plant invasions of a single ecosystem in southwestern Australia. We used extensive community data to calculate pairwise segregation between target alien species and many co-occurring species. We related segregation to species' positions along community trait hierarchies and identified at least two distinct invasion strategies: 'exploiters' which occupy high positions along key trait hierarchies and reduce local native species diversity (particularly in nutrient-enriched situations), and 'coexisters' who occupy intermediate trait positions and have no discernable impact on native diversity. We conclude that trait hierarchies, linked to measures of competition, can provide valuable insights about the processes driving different invasion outcomes.},
